### Outputs

##### Cube 

By pressing '1' in the program renders a cube into the scene. pressing 'H', 'J' and 'G' rotate the cube along the x, y, and z axis respectively. Cubes can be selected by pressing 'X' key and by pressing it again we can toggle between the cubes. Pressing 'K' and 'L' scale the cube up and down. Pressing 'I' renders Phong(smooth) shading on the cube, 'O' renders a wireframe and 'P' renders the cube in its original flat shading. Pressing 'Q' deletes the selected cube. The translation on the screen can be done by arrow keys in their corresponding direction. <br><br>
